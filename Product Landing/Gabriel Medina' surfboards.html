<h2>Here's a few of the Gabriel Medina's favourite surfboards!</h2>

    <h3>Puskas The GaMe</h3>

    <a class="desc" id="the_game-desc">This is the kind of board you want to be riding when it's small, plus it's really responsive and fun when it gets up to over head conditions. The first ever “The GAME” was tested by Gabriel Medina in Portugal, in a beachbreak close to Ericeira. His feedback was simple: “the board flys”. Waves were small and slow, typical beachbreak conditions and Gabriel loved it!</a>

    <h3>Puskas DFK</h3> 
    <img class="surfboards" id="dfk-img" src="https://cabiancasurfboards.com/public/media/2024/05/DFK_Moon.jpeg"/>
    <a class="desc" id="dfk_desc">From 'Da Freak Kid' to three-time world champion, we've loved watching Gabriel's ascent, from high-flying teen prodigy to the all-round surfing virtuoso he is today. Just like his surfing, Gabriel's go-to pro model surfboard has evolved constantly over the past years, and after years of constant development, we think it's the most refined, balanced and straight-up magic board in our lineup.</a>

  <section id="the_medina">
    <h3>The Medina</h3>
    <img class="surfboards" id="the_medina-img"  src="https://cabiancasurfboards.com/public/media/2024/04/Medina_bw.jpeg"/>
    <a class="desc" id="the_medina-desc">Being the world's best contest surfer isn't all about destroying the world's best waves: it's often more about winning decisive heats in marginal conditions. And that's where The Medina comes in - a high performance shape that's designed to make the most of low-performance waves.
  Low rocker from nose to tail makes The Medina a fast paddler, helping you to get more waves, and make more sections. Meanwhile the concave to V bottom, and a flatter dome deck makes this board stable, yet very lively and responsive. Get this board 2 inches shorter than your usual shortboard. Whatever your level, the Medina will turn your bad days into fun days… and good days into classic days.</a>
